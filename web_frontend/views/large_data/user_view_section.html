    Remember when you've used a great application with high UX and it almost felt effortless? Remember other application you've used and you hated them because it was energy draining?
    
    Good UX = effortless or essentially, minimum energy needed to accomplish desired tasks Bad UX = draining, or essentially, high energy needed to accomplish desired tasks
    
    Defining UX this way will be important and will be key in how you focus on improving your UX skills.
    
    Designing an application or any product with a high user satsifaction is what the goal of UX is. In this course, you'll learn some of the fundamentals of what makes a great user experience. It's also important to know what UX is not as a lot of people often get used between UX and design.</p></p>

                        <p id="tab_content_5" class="tab_content"><p>To think about why UX is important, imagine you went back 200 years ago, back in the days when you would take a horse carriage ride to go from point A to point B. In fact, imagine this was an important travel route for many people, where thousands of people each day traveled from point A to point B and point B back to point A. We'll say that the energy consumption for solving this need this way consumes energy of 100kJ.</p><p>Imagine that when there has been a new route discovered and that now people can go from point A to point B with 20% less energy! This form of energy could be 20% less in terms of energy needed to stay awake and alert, or could even save 20% of the time (where we would argue that wasting time is also a form of energy as no one likes to waste time and wasting time is energy draining!). Do you think people would all move immediately to this new enhanced UX solution? Maybe not immediately, but eventually, once people have all been exposed to this better UX solution, they will most likely switch over.</p><p>Imagine that there is a breakthrough and someone created a new transportation device (e.g., a car) where it now takes 10X less energy to go from point A to point B. When that happens, it's a whole new industry where the old industry is now disrupted. Designing a solution with 10X improvement (over the competitors or over an existing solution) creates a whole new era for that industry, and this is exactly what Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other major software firms have done.</p><p>You may be able to create a 10X UX improvement. If you do, you should talk to me so that we can work on that together. However, even if you were to create a 20-40%+ UX improvement in helping people achieve their desired tasks, you can build a healthy business.</p></p>

                        <p id="tab_content_4" class="tab_content"><p>UI stands for “User Interface.” Think of User Experience as designing an application in black and white and where you're doing things like rough sketches with pencil. UI is basically where a graphic designer takes that black/white version and adds color, beautiful icons, nice fonts, backgrounds, etc. UI is basically making things look beautiful in a color TV environment. UX is designing things for a simple black/white TV.</p></p>

Adding UI is basically where you add color and have many different cars with different colors and looks.</p><p>In this context, which one is more important and innovative? UX or UI? The clear winner is UX. UX comes first, and then UI comes later. </p><p>UI is what looks right, and UX is what feels right. UI is like the book cover that is pleasing to the eyes, and UX is like the book's content that taps the inner emotions of readers when they read it. In other words, UX is what pleases the users’ emotions. </p></p>

It's because it costs less energy to accomplish the desired tasks!  The desired tasks for the user is basically 'as a user, I want to login to the application!'.  Note that for a typical registration form where you have to click and type your name, email address, password, confirm password, etc, and then login afterwards, this could easily have an energy cost of 300-500 energy consumption points (according to the scale above).  Now, the the user using FB login or Google login could achieve their desired outcome by only having to click 2 times (20 energy cost).  That's a 10X+ improvement.  No wonder people prefer FB login or Google login instaed of manually registering and loggin in.</p></p>

                        <p id="tab_content_9" class="tab_content"><p>In the end, a great UX is one that requires the least energy. This is not only hand and eye energy but also the energy required by the users to think.</p><p>Now, for me, this is the most important energy to reduce. Why? Because every action usually starts with thinking. And if your users think less, they use less eye and hand energy. </p><p>Remember that when the users are using your application, they have certain 'tasks' they are trying to accomplish. Another way to put this is that they have urgent 'user stories' they are trying to meet.</p><p>Remember that features and user stories can all be categorized as the following:</p><p>When you have a page in your application that has a lot of elements (e.g., buttons, texts, headers, images, links, etc.), it requires the brain to be actively engaged so that it filters out unnecessary information. If the page is complex and has lots of elements, this 'filtering' takes enormous thought energy.</p><p>Ways to reduce thought energy are as follows:</p><ol><li>Don't include any need-to-have features. Avoid these like the plague.</li><li>Know what must-have features are and which are nice-to-have features. It's okay to include nice-to-have features, but as soon as you get confused about which are must-haves vs. nice have, you're off to a bad start.</li><li>Use font size, color, or contrast ratio to make the must-to-have features stand out more than the nice-to-have features.</li><li>Use proven layouts to make information flow naturally. Avoid creating your own custom layout that the users are not used to seeing. Stick with the best practices layout that's appropriate for your application size (e.g., desktop, mobile, tablet).</li><li>Use appropriate messaging to address the user's needs or to guide the users. For example, adding a one-sentence or a short description about what the key feature is and explaining that in a text to the user can be helpful. Especially as new users are navigating through your application.</li></ol><p>As you get into UX, you'll hear people saying, 'Don't make me think!'. Using your application should be almost effortless and intuitive. You do this by knowing what are must to have features and also by better understanding your user base. Do all the thinking so that your users won’t have to.</p></p>

I really enjoyed attending the course and learned a lot during it. All of the material was presented very clearly and it was very easy to understand all of the information that was covered. At the end of the course, I was able to create a fully functional website on my own using the skills that I had learned during the class. I would recommend this bootcamp to anyone interested in learning how to develop websites. It was a great experience and I learned a lot from it.",
